1. call given url and get all links 
push as array with given url being [0]

2. for urlArr[i]
fetch and get all links
push as array with urlArr[i] being the key

do for all urlArr 


3. then create object

with returned object 
- take second key's values and repeat the process

to avoid duplicates 
- make an array of all keys (visitedUrls)

if url matches one of the keys in visitedUrls, skip so as to not duplicates


repeat process when you get another array with arr[0] being the fetched url and all elements after being the links
- once complete add array to object  
- arr[0] is the key and everything else is the value.

How to stop ?

- after all entries
