Implementation 

WHY DID YOU ORGANISE THE CODE THIS WAY
- The src folder includes all the functions that are used in the main webcrawl function
- I separated the functionality so that I was writing pure functions that performed only one operation
* makes it easier to write unit tests 

WHAT WOULD YOU IMPROVE 
- Error handling
